# PyView - Interactive NetCDF Viewer for Jupyter

A Python-based interactive netCDF viewer designed for Jupyter notebooks. Provides ncview-like functionality optimized for remote server usage.

![PyView Interface](examples/pyview.png)

## Features

- **Four Plot Types**: Geographic maps, depth profiles, time series, Hovm√∂ller diagrams
- **Smart Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons with coordinate values and wrap-around
- **Real-time Statistics**: Automatic min/max/mean updates and valid cells
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode themes
- **Manual Color Range**: Text-based range inputs for precise control
- **Smart Validation**: Only shows valid plot types based on data dimensions

## Quick Start

```python
from pyview import pyview

# Open your netCDF file
viewer = pyview('your_file.nc')
```

## Installation

### Automated Setup
```bash
# Clone or download the PyView repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pyview.git
cd pyview

# Run the automated setup script
bash setup_env.sh

# Activate the environment
conda activate pyview
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install xarray matplotlib ipywidgets numpy netcdf4

# For Jupyter Lab
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
```

## Usage Examples

```python
# Basic usage
viewer = pyview('your_file.nc')

# With dark theme
viewer = pyview('your_file.nc', dark_mode=True)

# Custom dimension mapping
viewer = pyview(file_path,
                dark_mode=False,
                dim_mapping={
                    'lat': 'yt_ocean',
                    'lon': 'xt_ocean',
                    'depth': 'st_ocean'
                    })

# Show detected dimensions
viewer.show_dimension_mapping()
```
